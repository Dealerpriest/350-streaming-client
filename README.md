# 360-streaming-client

This is a Vue webapp for handling live 360 video streams. The user should be able to look around and in different ways control the 360 view.
An important part of the app is to map the equirectangular 360-image to a sphere in a 3D environment.
Code related to that were taken and modified/adapted from parts of the teleroomba project by Rubin Huang.
